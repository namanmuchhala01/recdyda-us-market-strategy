# RECYDA: U.S. Market Expansion Strategy

## Project Overview

This project outlines a strategic market entry plan for RECYDA, a German SaaS startup focused on sustainable solutions, into the United States market. The strategy was developed as a winning submission for a hackathon at Università di Pavia.

## Key Objectives

* Facilitate RECYDA's successful entry into the U.S. market.
* Identify and target key U.S. states with favorable market conditions.
* Develop a phased entry plan to maximize market share and impact.
* Align RECYDA's expansion with its commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption).

## Strategic Analysis

The following analyses were conducted to inform the market entry strategy:

* **PESTEL Analysis:** Examined the political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors influencing the U.S. market.
* **SWOT Analysis:** Evaluated RECYDA's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
* **Porter's Five Forces:** Assessed the competitive landscape and industry attractiveness.
* **Regulatory Landscape Analysis:** Focused on recycling laws and sustainability trends across six key states: California (CA), New York (NY), Michigan (MI), and others.

## Market Entry Strategy

* **Direct E-commerce Export:** Recommended a direct e-commerce export strategy to minimize initial investment and maximize reach.
* **Target States:** Prioritized states with complex recycling regulations, such as California (due to its 2032 single-use plastic ban), to align with RECYDA's mission.
* **Phased Entry Plan:** Proposed a phased approach focusing on:
    * **Phase 1:** Targeting B2B clients (packaging manufacturers, waste management firms).
    * **Phase 2:** Expanding to broader markets and partnerships.
* **SDG Alignment:** Ensured the strategy supports Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption).
